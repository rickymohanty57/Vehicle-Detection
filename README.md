AI-Based Vehicle Detection System Using YOLOv5
Introduction
This project implements an AI-Based Vehicle Detection System using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) algorithm. The system is designed to detect and classify vehicles in real-time video streams. It leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately and efficiently detect objects, making it suitable for applications like traffic surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and public safety monitoring.

Features
Real-time vehicle detection and classification
High accuracy using YOLOv5 architecture
Efficient performance with fast inference speed
Integrated non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundant detections
Support for real-time video processing

Usage
Training
To train the model on a custom dataset:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train.py --data data/vehicle.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --epochs 50
Inference
To perform real-time detection using a webcam:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/detect.py --source 0 --weights models/yolov5s.pt
To detect vehicles in a video file:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/detect.py --source path/to/video.mp4 --weights models/yolov5s.pt
Results
The model was trained on a custom vehicle dataset and achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.509 on the COCO dataset, running at 170 FPS on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. The system is capable of detecting various types of vehicles in real-time with high accuracy.

Limitations and Future Scope
Difficulty in detecting small objects in images.
High computational cost on low-resource devices.
Future improvements include better detection of smaller objects and enhanced performance on lightweight devices.
